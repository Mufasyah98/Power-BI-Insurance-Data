### Metrics to Analyze Agent Performance for Predictive Segmentation

To improve agent segmentation using supervised predictive frameworks, consider analyzing the following metrics categorized into **Demographics**, **Product Metrics**, **Sales Performance**, **Retention and Growth**, and **Behavioral Insights**. This structured approach provides comprehensive data for predictive modeling and actionable insights.

---

#### 1. **Demographics**
Understanding agent attributes that correlate with performance helps identify successful profiles.
- **Agent Age**: Age groups to assess trends in performance by experience.
- **Tenure with the Company**: Years associated with the group.
- **Location (State/Region)**: Performance trends by geography.
- **Education/Certifications**: Influence of qualifications on sales.
- **Agency Size**: Number of employees or producers in the agency.

---

#### 2. **Product Metrics**
Analyze product-specific metrics to determine an agent's expertise and market focus.
- **Product Portfolio Mix**: Percentage of policies sold per line (e.g., property, casualty, life).
- **Policy Count by Product**: Volume of policies sold in each category.
- **Policy Renewal Rate by Product**: Retention of clients across product lines.
- **Cross-Selling Rate**: Frequency of selling multiple policies to the same customer.

---

#### 3. **Sales Performance**
Quantify sales success and revenue generation to identify high-performing agents.
- **New Business Premium (NB_WRTN_PREM_AMT)**: Premiums from newly acquired customers.
- **Total Written Premium (WRTN_PREM_AMT)**: Overall premium volume.
- **Sales Conversion Rate**: Policies bound vs. quotes provided.
- **Monthly Growth Rate**: Sales growth over time (e.g., GROWTH_RATE_3YR).
- **Active Producers**: Number of agents actively contributing to sales.

---

#### 4. **Retention and Growth**
Identify customer loyalty and the agent's ability to sustain and grow their book of business.
- **Retention Ratio**: Policies retained vs. those lapsed.
- **Loss Ratio**: Claims paid vs. premiums collected, indicating underwriting quality.
- **Client Tenure**: Average duration clients stay with an agent.
- **Upselling Success Rate**: Upgrading existing clients to higher-value products.

---

#### 5. **Behavioral Insights**
Include qualitative and quantitative measures of agent activities.
- **Client Interaction Notes**: Frequency and quality of follow-ups.
- **Vendor/Tool Usage**: Efficiency in utilizing platforms (e.g., eQT, PLRANK).
- **Productivity Metrics**: Policies quoted vs. policies bound per platform.
- **Claim Handling Efficiency**: Time taken to resolve client claims.
- **Training and Development Participation**: Frequency and impact of attending skill-building programs.

#### **Improvisation: Advanced Analysis for Supervised Learning**
To prepare for supervised predictive segmentation:
1. **Target Variable**: Define agent success based on retention ratio, growth rate, or new business premiums.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create derived variables like:
   - **Revenue per Policy**: Average revenue earned per policy.
   - **Agent Diversity Index**: Range of products sold per agent.
   - **Claim-to-Sales Ratio**: Proportion of claims filed to policies sold.
3. **Clustering Analysis**: Group agents based on performance patterns before building predictive models.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Identify significant predictors for high performance (e.g., retention rates or demographics).
5. **Modeling**: Use algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression for predictive segmentation.
